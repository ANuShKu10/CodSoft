
# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator application written in Python. This application can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling for division by zero)



## Requirements
Python 3.x / VS CODE

## How To Run 

#### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator.git

```
#### 2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
 cd simple-calculator

```
#### 3. Run the Python script.
```bash
python calculator.py

```

## Usage
#### When you run the script, you will be prompted to:
- Enter the first number.
- Enter the second number.
- Enter the operation you wish to perform ('+','-','*','/').
#### The program will then display the result of the operation.
## Example
#### Simple Calculator
- Enter first number: 10
- Enter second number: 5
- Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
- The result is: 15.0

## Code Explanation

#### The code consists of four basic arithmetic functions and a main function that takes user input and performs the desired operation:

- add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
- subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
- multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
- divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x divided by y, with error handling for division by zero.
#### The 'main()' function prompts the user for two numbers and an operation, then calls the appropriate function to compute and display the result.
